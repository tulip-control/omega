A TLA+ specification and proofs of relevant properties for
an algorithm that computes the cyclic core of a minimal
covering problem. This algorithm was originally proposed
in the context of two-level logic minimization.

The modules:

FiniteSetTheorems,
Functions,
FunctionTheorems,
NaturalsInduction,
SequenceTheorems,
TLAPS,
WellFoundedInduction

can be found in the distribution of TLAPS v1.4.3:

https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/dist/1.4.3/tlaps-1.4.3.tar.gz

The proofs have been checked with TLAPS v1.4.3, in the presence of:
    - Zenon v0.7.2
    - CVC3 v2.4.1
    - Isabelle v2011-1
    - LS4 (commit c5e907eb3be9d454b3365e747c05100bdffa939c)
